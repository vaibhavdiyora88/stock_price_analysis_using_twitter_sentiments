#an_inspection_of_restaurants_in_NYC

The goal of our analysis is to figure out which variables in our dataset have the most influence on the inspection score awarded to each data observation, which is each individual restaurant in the city of New York.

If we were to dine at one restaurant in NYC every day, it would take us 68 years to have dined in each and every one of them. When we consider the limited amount of resources the government has for the inspection of restaurants to maintain a good standard of health and hygiene we see that there is a big discrepancy. Essentially, there are 24,294 unique restaurants in NYC and there are limited resources that can be used towards there regulation. Our analysis of the data will allow us to make recommendations to improve the allocation of the governmentâ€™s resources which will work towards not only maintain the health and hygiene of the city but also work towards better usage of the budget.

We start parsing through the data with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) approach. First, we remove the absolute duplicates, values that are the same on all levels of the data. Then, we proceed to conduct a multiple univariate, and bivariate analysis to get a better understanding of our data set to see how the data is distributed and, in this exploration, we also look for outliers, missing values, and unexpected values. Once we cleaned the data we created a linear multiple regression model using the variables. Furthermore, we create more models that include more of the independent variables to find the best representation of the dataset.

We did find one study on LinkedIn performed by a masters group from Carnegie Melon University that had used the same dataset. This team used supervised and unsupervised learning to make recommendations on identifying violation trends, predicting violations, and reducing violations. Their approach was similar to ours in so far as to use one statistical method, in this case supervised and unsupervised learning, to identify certain opportunities and make some recommendations.
